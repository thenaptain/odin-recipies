        <li>1 Large Bulb of Garlic Finely Chopped</li>
        <li>2-4 Scotch Bonnet Peppers chopped very fine* (Depending on your desired heat levels)</li>
        <li>5 tbsp West African Red Palm Oil</li>
        <li>Glug of Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2tsp Lion Brand Nigerian Curry Powder (or more if required)</li>

        <li>8-10 Nigerian Knorr stock cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a big pot, boil the meat in hot water with the onion cut into quarters, salt and about 3 or 4 maggi cubes. Let the meat boil for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After boiling, strain the liquid but keep the liquid and then put the meat under the grill to crisp up a bit.</li>
        <li>While the meat is boiling, put the veg oil and palm oil together in another pot and fry it up for 5ish minutes - it will smoky as the palm oil evaporates - let this happen.</li>
        <li>Then put in chopped onions and garlic and scotch bonnet. Let that fry for a few minutes - lower the temperature so the onions and garlic fry gently until soft.<ul><li>Add in tomatoes and bell peppers to the onion mixture and fry for about 15 minutes.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Then pour some of the liquid from the boiled meat into the pot along with the curry powder & thyme & other maggi cubes and let cook for while - 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then add in the grilled meat and continue cooking for a while on a very low heat, while you are chilling with your beer (that last part is Bob's addition!!)</li>
