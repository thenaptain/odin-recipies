        <li>Eggs <ul><li>5 Eggs for rice</li><li>1 Egg per person for frying</li></ul></li>
        <li>2cups (When raw) of pre-cooked Golden Sella Basmati Rice</li>
        <li>2 Carrots finely diced</li>
        <li>6 Garlic Cloves and 6 Thai Chillies smashed</li>
        <li>Kale</li>
        <li>Desert spoon of sugar (light brown Muscavado if available)</li>
        <li>Oyster Sauce</li>
        <li>Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>Thai 'thin" Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>To Serve</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Half a lime per person</li>
        <li>Fresh Coriander</li>
        <li>Chopped Thai chillies in a little pot of fish sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p>Prepare ingredients first - chopping meat and veg, washing kale, smashing garlic & ginger, beating eggs for fried rice. It's quick cooking so it's good to have them ready. 
        Best to use a non-stick wok for this.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bit of oil in wok - high heat</li>
        <li>Throw in chicken (if using) - chopped quite small. Cook fairly well, not just browning outside.</li>
        <li>Throw in carrots, garlic & chilli and give a good blitz - don't burn garlic (throw in green beans too if using)</li>
        <li>Throw in some of the rice - stir around and get it all coated by the chicken fat & oil - maybe half a wok full.</li>
        <li>Put all contents of wok in a big bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make sure wok is free of rice - don't wash the wok though. Put in another tiny drop of oil, heat briefly and then throw in the beaten eggs.</li>
        <li>Stir around so kind of like scrambled egg (but not as scrambled) - don't overcook but as getting there, start to add back in the previous contents of the wok that had been set aside in a bowl. Give a good stir (play around with temperatures but it might be a good idea to lower slightly at this point).</li>
        <li>Add in a few glugs of soy sauce, fish sauce & oyster sauce - play around with how much. You don't want it to go brown with too much sauce added but equally you don't want it to be tasteless.</li>
        <li>Add in spoonful sugar</li>
        <li>Keep adding in more rice as needed and mixing together.</li>
        <li>Add more soy sauce, fish sauce & oyster sauce as necessary</li>
        <li>Start adding in kale bit by bit, stirring it into the rice mixture as it wilts and cooks.</li>
        <li>Set aside at a low temperature and now put some oil (generous amount) in a frying pan on a very very high heat.</li>
        <li>When oil is really at a high temperature, start frying your eggs for those eating (one per person) - you want to get a lovely crispy white and yet still with a fairly runny egg.</li>
        <li> Assemble nice big portion on a plate with fried egg on top, throw over some coriander and a lime wedge on the side.
            16. Enjoy eating. Add in thai chillies or fish sauce from the little pot as you wish.
            </li>
    </ol>
